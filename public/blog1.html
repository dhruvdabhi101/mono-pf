<p>When I was in first year of my uni, I was totally into coding, I
coded every single day without doing anything extra. I just coded
different things, learned different things, also shared those things
with my friends and on X (previously twitter).</p>
<p>But I was getting burnt out too quickly, like every other month I
felt that i needed break, and i took one week of breat where i wasn’t
doing anything other than watching movies, or going out with
friends.Then I felt refreshed for sometime and loop went on.</p>
<p>One time, I got rejected by my crush, before that I was solely
focusing on her and coding, so my focus shifted from her and started
reading self-help books as coping mechanism.</p>
<p>My first book was Atomic Habits, and It changed my life, not like I
started following what that book told, but It made me interested in
reading books in general, after self help books, I started reading
philosphical books and journey went on.</p>
<p>I was coding at that time too, but my schedule had other time where I
was reading, like while travelling or in the break between lectures.
Before I was only thinking about solving problems and talking about
coding to my friends, as if it was my whole personality. But then yeah,
reading came into the life and it kind of fixed my thinking ability and
I felt burnt out less often.</p>
<p>Then I started playing ukulele, I don’t play it often, but twice or
thrice I practice it, and It’s fun, Whenever I am unable to solve some
bug I just play uke for some time and it shifts my mind from the
program, and after some time, solution automatically comes to the mind,
I heard about this kind of focus switching from a youtube video, most
probably Ali Abdaal said about this in his videos. It basically helps
with creative thoughts.</p>
<p>After that I started working out regularly, I was doing it before
too, but not regularly, I was doing it like 2-3 times a week, but now I
do it 5-6 times a week, and I feel more energetic and focused. I do not
even need to sit for hours in front of laptop, I am now able to do my
work in less time, and also able to focus on other things too. Here are
some hobbies that I recommend you to try</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Working out</li>
<li>Journaling (I do it too, but not too often, I just write whenever I
feel anxious)</li>
<li>Playing any instrument (Guitar, Piano, Ukulele)</li>
<li>Do any sport</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobbies help you not get burnt out easily, makes you a better person,
and also helps you with your career. I am not saying that you should not
code, but you should not code all the time, you should have other
hobbies too, which will help you in long run.</p>
