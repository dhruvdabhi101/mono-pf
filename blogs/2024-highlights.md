## Introduction

2024 was a year of learning and growth for me, mostly i have got to learn so many stuff, but unfortunetly I didn't master any new thing.
I have failed so many things this year, met with love of my life, got placed at a company, freelanced, got part time job and so many other things.
So here is the gist of it.

## Advice to myself
- Keep learning new things, but also master them.
- Most thing i heard from interviewer was that i know a lot of things, but i don't master them, so focus on mastering them.
- Keep working on hobby projects, they are fun and also helps you learn new things.
- Go gym regularly, you went to gym, but wasn't regular, so be regular from now on.
- Keep writing, you wrote only one blog last year, and this is 2nd, so write more and teach as much as possible, and don't let other people make same mistake as you.
- Keep poasting on X, you were so inconsistent, so be consistent from now on.
- Don't settle for mediocrity, you are better than that, keep pushing harder.

## What I will do in 2025
- Lot of leetcode
- Master C/C++ programming with computer architecture (become cracked)
- Get goot at Fundamentals of Computer Science
- Learn to think from first principles


## Conclusion
I have so much to improve, and so much to learn, amazing year it was, but i have to make 2025 more amazing.
**Happy New Year**
